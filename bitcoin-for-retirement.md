**Subject: Safeguarding Your Retirement: Using Bitcoin to Protect Against Inflation**

Dear Editor,

>_Optional recap - In [last week's letter](./bitcoin-and-renewable-energy.md), I shared how Bitcoin is quietly helping renewables thrive by balancing energy loads and even monetizing wasted methane. But the benefits of this technology aren’t just for power grids—they might just protect your nest egg too._

Sometimes I hear: “Bitcoin is too volatile for savings.”

Fair point—it does jump around like a young colt in a new pasture. But let’s not confuse short-term jitters with long-term strength. After all, we don’t judge the sturdiness of a tree by how its branches sway in the wind, but by how deep its roots go. And over time, Bitcoin’s roots—its fixed supply, growing adoption, and resistance to manipulation—have only deepened.

Let me put it plainly: inflation is eating our savings. If your retirement account is sitting in dollars, it's like storing ice on a hot day. It's melting away. Since 1971, when the U.S. left the gold standard, the dollar has lost over 85% of its purchasing power. That means what cost \$1 back then costs nearly \$8 today. Eggs, rent, college, even a simple trip to the grocery store—prices keep rising, and our savings can’t keep up.

Stocks and real estate used to be the go-to hedge, but even those are tied to interest rates, debt cycles, and government bailouts. Bonds? Don’t get me started. These days, they often lose to inflation outright. And Social Security? Many worry it’s on shaky ground. We need a plan B.

Enter Bitcoin—not as a get-rich-quick scheme, but as a long-term savings tool. Unlike the dollar, Bitcoin has a fixed supply: 21 million coins, ever. No printing press. No surprise dilution. That scarcity gives it a backbone. It’s like digital gold, but easier to store, easier to send, and available to anyone with a phone and a bit of curiosity.

Now, I’m not saying you should bet the farm. But even allocating a small percentage of your retirement into Bitcoin—say 1% to 5%—can act like fire insurance on your financial future. Many institutions, like Fidelity and BlackRock, are already integrating Bitcoin into retirement products. If they see the writing on the wall, maybe we should too.

> #### Optional series plug
> And there’s more. In next week’s letter, we’ll look at how Bitcoin isn’t just helping retirees—it’s giving a voice and a bank to folks the system has left behind.
>
>Until then, I invite you to do what our grandparents did with gold and land—find tools that last. Bitcoin might just be one of them.

Warmly,

[Your name]
