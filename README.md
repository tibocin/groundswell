# 📬 Groundswell: Letter to the Editor Template Repository

Welcome to **Groundswell**—an open-source collection of letter-to-the-editor templates designed to spread awareness about Bitcoin through the written word, one local paper at a time.

This repository is a tool for decentralized education, local persuasion, and cultural awakening. Every letter is crafted with clarity, accessibility, and purpose—meant to be *used*, *tweaked*, and *published* by individuals who want to see financial sovereignty and open-source values thrive in their communities.

## 🌱 Why Letters to the Editor?

Letters to the editor have reach. They are short, personal, and potent. They hit the kitchen table, not just the feed. And best of all, they give everyday people a voice in the public square—something Bitcoin defends at its core.

But writing a letter can feel intimidating or unclear. That’s why we’ve created these easy-to-adapt templates—so that more people can step into the role of local advocate with confidence and clarity.

## 📣 Who Are These For?

These letters are written for a general audience, targeting a middle school reading level to ensure broad accessibility.

Whether you’re:

- A **retiree** watching inflation chip away at savings,
- A **philanthropist** seeking more transparent giving tools,
- A **climate advocate** curious about Bitcoin’s energy story,
- A **normie** who just wants to understand what this “magic internet money” really is,
- A **libertarian**, **community builder**, **tech worker**, or **freedom maximalist**...

There’s a letter here for you—and a newspaper that needs your voice.
